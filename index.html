								<h3>Bio</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="george brown casa loma campus" /></span>
								<p>I’m a third year student at George Brown studying in the Computer Programmer Analyst field. I’ve had an interest in computers & technology from a young age. As a teenager I took a computer repair course and found I excelled in it. This interest thrust me into the field of technology, and I began studying web development and Python on my own time in between breaks at work, before attending George Brown in 2017.</p>
								<p>After college, I’d like to continue my education in university and get a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. From there I’d like to gain a career in the field of DevOps, and eventually find work in different places around the world.</p>
								<p>In the future I’d like to teach programming to children. I was inspired by many of the great teachers at George Brown who made programming fun and I’d like to pass that on to others as well.</p>

								<h3>Philosophy</h3>
								<p>My philosophy on work is that I believe a good job should be rewarding, but also challenging, that it should provide an outlet for your creativity, and a sense of satisfaction upon completion. As a student in the technology field, I’ve faced challenges that, at the time, seemed insurmountable. But each time I’ve faced difficulties, I’ve come out more knowledgeable and prepared for the workplace.</p>
								<p>I enjoy the sense of challenge that programming provides, and I believe that there is no greater satisfaction than finally working through a difficult error, a problem that seemed impossible to fix. Seeing the program you’ve created come alive underneath your fingertips brings a level of joy that’s unrivaled by any other job I’ve ever had.</p>
								<p>“The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is the lawgiver. No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful, has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.”</p>
								<p>― Joseph Weizenbaum</p>
